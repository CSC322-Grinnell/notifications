Feature: Create, read, update, and delete students

  As a teacher 
  So that I can manage the database of students
  I want to create, read, update, and delete students.

Background: there is a student in the database
  Given the following classrooms exist:
  | name |
  | Room |
  | Party |
  
  Given the following contacts exist:
  | name      | Phone_Number  | Email          | language | can_text  |
  | Uzo Nwike | 5159916928    | uzo@email.com  | English  | true      |

  Given the following students exist:
  | student_name |
  | Adam Hudson  |
  
  #Given the following students_classrooms exist:
    
  #| Student       | Classrooms                |
  #| Adam Hudson   | Room                      |

  Given the following users exist:

  | name          | email              | password  | password_confirmation | login              | admin |

  Then I should be on the details page for "Wayne Rooney"
